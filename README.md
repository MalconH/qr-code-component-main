## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM Methodology
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me to practice BEM Methodology. I still feel a
little bit rusty on that, for sure need to work more on it.

Overall this is pretty basic project so there's no much to be learn, but it does
helps to reinforce and to put into practice what I've learned. Small and simple
projects like this helps to put into practice my knowledges and built-up
confidence in my skills!

What particularly I got to have in mind is to start from little things and then
build up from there, and then everything will sorta get in its position easier!
The key is to break down a complex problem into smaller ones.

### Continued development

- Definitely **BEM Methodology** is one of them!
- Got to lookup about types of components and their names.
- I should get use to use `em` units more often, to get comfy using them.
- Using GitHub.
